Lib-STATIC is a minimal computing-based approach to creating data-driven tools leveraging static-web technologies (enabled by generators such as Jekyll and a "JAM" stack approach) and librariansâ€™ specialized skills in metadata and classification to create engaging web publications via three components: a spreadsheet with well-formed metadata, a directory of assets, and a configuration file.
