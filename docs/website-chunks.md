## Concepts

marii: understand ideas and shared terms 

dcnb: I think it would help me to determine why we’re writing these – is it to help someone generally understand these concepts OR is it to help someone understand how they might understand these concepts in the service/use of the frameworks/utilities were collecting? I was sort of operating with the latter in mind. 

evanwill: One thing I was thinking in the audience for these little pieces is when writing grants or articles or even workshops I often want to just link out to a definition of these concepts in context of static projects--and always struggle to find a good reference. We often link to more industry-slanted sites like jamstack, digitalocean, or cloudcannon, or to more general sites like wikipedia. I would love a library centric place to link to--especially something like "static vs dynamic"--that would have a clear definition in context, why it is important for static stuff, and some further resources. So that is sort of how I was imagining my little pieces so far.

chrisdaaz: I wrote this templates draft thinking about transferrable skills library workers may need when using Lib-static methodologies. For me, the ability to create and modify templates in static site generators was a HUGE selling point. I wouldn’t know where to begin accessing templates in a PHP or Rails app, but Jekyll / Hugo / Pandoc make them highly visible. Once I learned Jekyll templating, I was able to learn other generators (and themes) very quickly. With templates, I can now generate weird library things like OAI-PMH feeds and MARC records… That said, I am a little worried that the templates thing I wrote might not actually be useful because it is *not* specific to a use case or tool. I only learned this stuff by necessity, because I need to do one specific thing in one specific context. But maybe I would have been better off learning the concepts first before struggling in the details…

## Paths

blog post like narratives of "how we did it", "what worked for us", "why we made these choices", trade off, benefits, recommendations, lessons learned.

marii: see what's possible via others' experiences
dcnb: This should be a blog-post type reflection on an individual experience that illustrates the possibilities of the lib-static approach for dh/librarian/GLAM workers
