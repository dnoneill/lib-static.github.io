description: "The Oral History as Data (OHD) tool is a static website generator that allows users to analyze and publish coded oral history or qualitative interview files. By turning transcriptions into tagged/coded CSV files, adding a list of filters, and creating a simple markdown file for each interview (to be included in the _transcipt collection), OHD will provide filterable transcripts and a color coded visualization for all transcripts included." # short description providing contextual information about the uses, technologies, examples, tools, and/or category the recipe addresses

### Context

Oral History as Data (OHD) was initially developed by Devin Becker for use in his CTRL-Shift web project in order to visualize the coded subjects for each interview. It has since been more fully developed and implemented into oral history collection sites for the Voices of Gay Rode and Idaho Queered projects and used as the analysis tool for a qualitative study of University of Idaho researchers. The development of the tool has has been supported by funding from the University of Idaho Library's [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](http://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu) and IMLS.
