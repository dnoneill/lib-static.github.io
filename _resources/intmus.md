description: "Integrated Musicianship is an open-source, interactive, online textbook for college-level music theory courses. The textbook uses the affordances of a static web workflow to maximize flexibility and support a responsive inquiry-based model of instruction. It adds editable, interactive musical examples using abcjs to avoid external embeds. All content is written in Markdown, with contributions from course graduate assistants to incorporate direct feedback from each class session." # short description providing contextual information about the uses, technologies, examples, tools, and/or category the recipe addresses
