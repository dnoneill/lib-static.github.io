Using a light-weight agile sprint framework, participants in this symposium will meet over the course of the week to discuss the lib-STATIC concept and envision ways and websites through which we can provide resources and assistance for our DH and library colleagues who would like to use static web/minimal computing techniques to develop web projects and templates. 

## Objectives

- Establish supportive and sustainable structures for the nascent lib-STATIC community
- Discuss and develop a draft of the Lib-STATIC website, which will feature static web tools, projects, code, tutorials, howtos, and sundry other materials related to learning how to develop using static web/minimal computing techniques
- Learn from each other's experiences and outlooks on creating, coding, and teaching with static web tools/techniques to develop library and digital scholarship web projects and templates.

## Participants

Marii Nyrop (NYU), Alex Gil (Columbia), Chris Diaz (Northwestern), Evan Williamson (University of Idaho), Devin Becker (University of Idaho), and Olivia Wikle (University of Idaho)
